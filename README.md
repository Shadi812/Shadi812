# Hi there 👋
Hi, I'm Shadi, a software developer based in New Jersey. My background in sales inspired me to explore new opportunities in software development, and I recently completed an intensive software engineering bootcamp hosted by Thinkful.

During the program, I learned industry best practices and software development standards, with a strong focus on technologies such as JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and RESTful APIs. I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications and working in a team environment, where I developed valuable skills in communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.

I'm passionate about using technology to create innovative solutions to real-world problems, and I'm always eager to learn new things and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the industry. Please feel free to connect with me if you have any questions or if you think we could collaborate on a project together.
